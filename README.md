# dockStupido

### NOTE: Some problems may occur on some distros, please report it!

dockStupido is a PHP-GTK dock, first write for Mate, but we planning to extend to others WM.

## Why?

Because I can! And because good docks is a death to create new applets.

## What is missing?

* Task list and pin icons are on initial dev
* Finish application menu
* Create a clock applet
* Create a system tray applet
* Create a sound applet
* Create installer to auto-start easy 
* Create an interface to configure config.json

## Installation

Get [PHP-GTK3](https://github.com/scorninpc/php-gtk3), complie or get appimage (but be careful, appimage not always updated).


## Usage

Just run:

```bash
./php-gtk3-x86_64-VERSION.AppImage dockStupido.php
```
